# Study of Extended Techniques and Muscular Memory applied to Fighting Games

<br>

## Introduction

In this treatise, I intend to aboard efficient and not so usual techniques for mechanical combo training in fighting games. Even though it is a basic aspect and initial for player of this genre, many players go through some difficulties when trying to execute some sequences, very often for not having a proper learning method, for having some kind of technical difficulty or for making their transition to an arcade stick.

Here, I intend to make clear some questions about how and why should we follow a determined pattern for combo training, for both people that are beginning to play fighting games right now or are trying to learn how to play with an arcade stick. I will use some of the knowledge of neurology, music theory, physiotherapy and pedagogy to show some fundamental answers to some of the questions brought here. I hope all of this interdisciplinarity gets to contribute to make the common knowledge more solid, with less “I guess“ as possible, that often comes in this kind of topic.

I really want to make clear that I want you to read and consider this document on its whole. Do not apply any of the technique here by itself without understanding the importance of each step. Read it and then come back to experiment each step in their respective order. None of these chapters survive by its own. I also have to make explicit that all of this work isn’t made to a specific game and it isn’t either about how to do advanced combos, even though I will talk and show them at one point and show why they become more possible.

The Objective here is to show advanced techniques to learn and execute in order to help the player to implement muscular memory more clearly, precisely and relaxed manner. Those are what will make the reader be able to execute harder combos. These are some examples of what became more viable with the tech I will show you:
<br>

* Garou: Mark of the Wolves - B. Jenet (13 Feint Cancels):

  <br>
* King of Fighters 98 - Kim Kaphwan (5 Haki Cancels):
  * https://youtu.be/NkHtHxC2YZk

<br>

#### Disclaimer about the videos:

```
Some people might end up doubting if the execution videos I made aren't using any kind of cheat to help. In Garou: Mark of the Wolves, there’s no necessity to prove that the combo execution is real, because it was done on an arcade cabinet. But, since Kim’s combo in King of Fighters ‘98 was done on the computer, some may doubt that the execution might have been tampered.

Therefore, for the people that doubt that it was done without any kind of help, you can check the video’s description to see the whole recording with no editing. Also, by the end of the video I prove that it was done without any cheating.
```

<br>
Like in the videos above, it’s possible to do advanced combos with what I will teach you here, but the main focus here is your execution and how to better it, and for that I will use the simplest examples I could bring and I will start from the most basic point when it comes to skill. The simples examples are essential since we don’t have to worry about nothing else besides execution methods, noteven about what we are executing. Futurely, the readers that will mature with these practices taught here will have maturity enough to direct themselves to study the game or combo on their own whenever they feel like.

Good read to everyone.

## Skill vs Ability

Since we aren't talking about mathematical sciences, it's hard to say what's wrong or right in fighting games. If we aboard it in a purely mechanical manner (as in hand position, layouts, arcade sticks, gamepads, hitboxes and etc.), it's hard to say what would be considered "the best way", since combos and attacks used in tournament level hardly goes far beyond the average level of execution in a game. Therefore, everything you need to win is within your skill range, be it on a stick, pad or whatever.

Though there's one thing you can be certain of: if you dropped a combo, that's because you still lack the skill to execute it or you practiced it wrong. Here we need to stablish two concepts: skill and ability. Keep in mind that we are considering both to be completely different things. I will give an example: Your eyes might see the same image as most people in the world, but you aren't able to read the same things that a japanese person would and they won't be able to read the things you can (in this case, assuming that both only know their native language). Both have the **ability** to see, but being able to read someone else's language is a **skill** that you can only earn by studying. Then, from that, we get the following points:
<br>

* If you drop combos of medium/low difficulty, you lack skill;
* If you have a hard time changing layouts from where your input comes from (gamepad, arcade stick, etc.) but you can play on your habitual controller, you lack skill in your new layout;
* If you can't do the harder combos of your own character, you lack the skill, or ability or both.

<br>

### Ability

Now that we stablished that **skill** and **ability** are different things, I can tell you that we can evolve in both departments, not necessarily at the same time, but without even having to play videogames for that. In our midst, we can say that a highly able person can exert a precise neuromuscular control of their fingers, in isolated and combined different movements. Having such notable ability doesn't mean necessarily that you already qualify as an excellent player, instrumentalist or typewriter, because such ability must be trained to its language, in other words, to its skill.

<br>

### Exercises for Neuromuscular Control
Here we finally begin some training. Below I will list some exercises that will improve your neuromuscular capacity for finger control. In order to make things easier to understand, I will mark each finger with a number:

<br>

The proposed exercises will be called: hug, hit, push and space. Below I will show each of them in order in the video:

<br>

Next, we have examples of wrong and right execution for all exercises:

* https://youtu.be/Ul4EQ6KNdM0

<br>

Keep in mind that we should avoid unnecessary efforts, much like in movement besides the finger you are training in each exercise. Everything must be done with the most control and looseness as possible, and that should be your priority: If you are exercising Finger 1, you move **ONLY** that finger, even if it's a small movement, in order to isolate the muscles in your hand that move them. Little by little, you start adding more amplitude and speed to these exercises.

After this first step, we can start doing finger combinations. The possible combinations of the fingers are:

* Combinations of 2 fingers: 1+2, 2+3, 3+4, 1+3, 2+4, 1+4;
* Combinations of 3 fingers: 2+3+4, 1+3+4, 1+2+4, 1+2+3.

<br>

Here is an example of combined finger training by using the "hug" exercise:

* https://youtu.be/gcXlahuUj5M

<br>

You can do the other exercises with combined fingers too, save for the "space" exercise, because that one is only done with the singular fingers (even if you did with combined it would be pretty redundant).
You should spend only 15 to 30 minutes everyday with this training, and shouldn't spend more time than that. If you hands start hurting you should stop immediately.
In order to have better control of our improvement, you can also use a metronome to help (you can use google for that, just google "metronome"). Adjust the speed to 120 BPM and do the movements every 4 beats. When you start getting used to it you can start raising the BPM. Here's a video of me doing the "push" exercise with the fingers 1+3 with a metronome:

<br>

Here's an observation: If you play with a gamepad since ever (like most people that play since childhood do), you probably have already developed your ability with your thumbs greatly. When you migrate to the arcade stick, you should consider the development of the movement of all fingers. Therefore, the exercises I just gave to you might help your training a lot. Practice them everyday if you feel you have a hard time move some of your fingers individually.
