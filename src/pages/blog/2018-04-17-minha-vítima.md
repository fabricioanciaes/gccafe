# Study of Extended Techniques and Muscular Memory applied to Fighting Games

<br>

## Introduction

In this treatise, I intend to aboard efficient and not so usual techniques for mechanical combo training in fighting games. Even though it is a basic aspect and initial for player of this genre, many players go through some difficulties when trying to execute some sequences, very often for not having a proper learning method, for having some kind of technical difficulty or for making their transition to an arcade stick.

Here, I intend to make clear some questions about how and why should we follow a determined pattern for combo training, for both people that are beginning to play fighting games right now or are trying to learn how to play with an arcade stick. I will use some of the knowledge of neurology, music theory, physiotherapy and pedagogy to show some fundamental answers to some of the questions brought here. I hope all of this interdisciplinarity gets to contribute to make the common knowledge more solid, with less “I guess“ as possible, that often comes in this kind of topic.

I really want to make clear that I want you to read and consider this document on its whole. Do not apply any of the technique here by itself without understanding the importance of each step. Read it and then come back to experiment each step in their respective order. None of these chapters survive by its own. I also have to make explicit that all of this work isn’t made to a specific game and it isn’t either about how to do advanced combos, even though I will talk and show them at one point and show why they become more possible.

The Objective here is to show advanced techniques to learn and execute in order to help the player to implement muscular memory more clearly, precisely and relaxed manner. Those are what will make the reader be able to execute harder combos. These are some examples of what became more viable with the tech I will show you:

<br>

* King of Fighters 98 - Kim Kaphwan (5 Haki Cancels):
    * https://youtu.be/NkHtHxC2YZk

<br>

#### Disclaimer about the videos:

>Some people might end up doubting if the execution videos I made aren't using any kind of cheat to help. In Garou: Mark of the Wolves, there’s no necessity to prove that the combo execution is real, because it was done on an arcade cabinet. But, since Kim’s combo in King of Fighters ‘98 was done on the computer, some may doubt that the execution might have been tampered.

>Therefore, for the people that doubt that it was done without any kind of help, you can check the video’s description to see the whole recording with no editing. Also, by the end of the video I prove that it was done without any cheating.

<br>
Like in the videos above, it’s possible to do advanced combos with what I will teach you here, but the main focus here is your execution and how to better it, and for that I will use the simplest examples I could bring and I will start from the most basic point when it comes to skill. The simples examples are essential since we don’t have to worry about nothing else besides execution methods, noteven about what we are executing. Futurely, the readers that will mature with these practices taught here will have maturity enough to direct themselves to study the game or combo on their own whenever they feel like.

Good read to everyone.

## Technique vs Skill

Since we aren't talking about mathematical sciences, it's hard to say what's wrong or right in fighting games. If we aboard it in a purely mechanical manner (as in hand position, layouts, arcade sticks, gamepads, hitboxes and etc.), it's hard to say what would be considered "the best way", since combos and attacks used in tournament level hardly goes far beyond the average level of execution in a game. Therefore, everything you need to win is within your technical range, be it on a stick, pad or whatever.

Though there's one thing you can be certain of: if you dropped a combo, that's because you still lack the skill to execute it or you practiced it wrong. Here we need to stablish two concepts: techinque and skill. Keep in mind that we are considering both to be completely different things. I will give an example: Your eyes might see the same image as most people in the world, but you aren't able to read the same things that a japanese person would and they won't be able to read the things you can (in this case, assuming that both only know their native language). Both have the ability (the **skill**) to see, but being able to read someone else's language is a **technique** that you can only earn by studying. Then, from that, we get the following points:
<br>

* If you drop combos of medium/low difficulty, you lack technique;
* If you have a hard time changing layouts from where your input comes from (gamepad, arcade stick, etc.) but you can play on your habitual controller, you lack technicality in your new layout;
* If you can't do the harder combos of your own character, you lack the technique, or skill or both.

<br>

### Skill

Now that we stablished that **technique** and **skill** are different things, I can tell you that we can evolve in both departments, not necessarily at the same time, but without even having to play videogames for that. In our midst, we can say that a highly able person can exert a precise neuromuscular control of their fingers, in isolated and combined different movements. Having such notable skill doesn't mean necessarily that you already qualify as an excellent player, instrumentalist or typewriter, because such ability must be trained to its language, in other words, to its technique.


<br>

### Exercises for Neuromuscular Control
Here we finally begin some training. Below I will list some exercises that will improve your neuromuscular capacity for finger control. In order to make things easier to understand, I will mark each finger with a number:

<br>

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GovWdVC.jpg)

<br>

The proposed exercises will be called: hug, hit, push and space. Below I will show each of them in order in the video:

* https://youtu.be/o9nHxQdZ-VA

<br>

Next, we have examples of wrong and right execution for all exercises:

* https://youtu.be/Ul4EQ6KNdM0

<br>

Keep in mind that we should avoid unnecessary efforts, much like in movement besides the finger you are training in each exercise. Everything must be done with the most control and looseness as possible, and that should be your priority: If you are exercising Finger 1, you move **ONLY** that finger, even if it's a small movement, in order to isolate the muscles in your hand that move them. Little by little, you start adding more amplitude and speed to these exercises.

After this first step, we can start doing finger combinations. The possible combinations of the fingers are:

* Combinations of 2 fingers: 1+2, 2+3, 3+4, 1+3, 2+4, 1+4;
* Combinations of 3 fingers: 2+3+4, 1+3+4, 1+2+4, 1+2+3.

<br>

Here is an example of combined finger training by using the "hug" exercise:

* https://youtu.be/gcXlahuUj5M

<br>

You can do the other exercises with combined fingers too, save for the "space" exercise, because that one is only done with the singular fingers (even if you did with combined it would be pretty redundant).
You should spend only 15 to 30 minutes everyday with this training, and shouldn't spend more time than that. If you hands start hurting you should stop immediately.
In order to have better control of our improvement, you can also use a metronome to help (you can use google for that, just google "metronome"). Adjust the speed to 120 BPM and do the movements every 4 beats. When you start getting used to it you can start raising the BPM. Here's a video of me doing the "push" exercise with the fingers 1+3 with a metronome:

* https://youtu.be/YObWKh8oOck

<br>

Here's an observation: If you play with a gamepad since ever (like most people that play since childhood do), you probably have already developed your ability with your thumbs greatly. When you migrate to the arcade stick, you should consider the development of the movement of all fingers. Therefore, the exercises I just gave to you might help your training a lot. Practice them everyday if you feel you have a hard time move some of your fingers individually.

<br>

### Technique

We saw that skill alone is simply about how agile our hands can be, and we can compare ourselves to musicians in this case. Here is an example of pure skillfulness:

* https://youtu.be/obs406VmUa8

<br>

Here we see that, though he is very skilled and capable, if someone who knows the musical language and recognizes technical problems, he would be able to tell that the sonority is polluted, the notes don't sound straight, there are some notes mistakes and etc. However, you can't say that there's no skill in it, or how would some say in the music community, talent.

In this case, we can see a musician that is extremely skillful in his technical plenitude:

* https://youtu.be/WSvjIUr9MHA

<br>

Now, sound is absolute, clear, clean and sound (no pun intended). All notes are audible, without noise, interference or failures. The sound quality is the result of a very well studied unique technique. This is confirmed when we pick musicians of same repertoire that requires less skill, but that needs the same technical control:

* https://youtu.be/20L6n9aZbkU
* https://youtu.be/BcI7M6OtyyI

The sound qualities, that come solely from the technical control, maintain themselves even in "difficult" repertoires or in "simpler" ones. In music, if sonority and wrong notes comes from the fruit of bad learning methods, in fighting games, dropped combos is the consequence of a inefficient training method.

## Demystifying the Learning Process

In order to make our learning process become more objective and efficient, we need firstly to understand what barriers are in our way. Let's see the first one of them:

<br>

### What is Difficulty?

Here, I ask you to stick with me in the following exercises, it might sound silly but they are important. The next exercise is absolutely fundamental to help me show you the ideas behind the study of technique. You will need a pen and a sheet of paper, and then make the following drawing:

[Insert Drawing 1 here]

<br>

Now, I need that you fill the space above the top main horizontal line with your name and surname, in **CAPITAL LETTERS** and reverse order (but not written in the "mirrored" way). If you already done that too many times, try picking another word, any will do as long as is an unusual word. In the end, it will look like this:

[Insert Drawing 2 here]

<br>

Next, you fill the bottom one with the same thing you wrote the first, but now in the normal order of letters:

[Insert Drawing 3 here]

<br>

Keeping on the exercise, you can put the following attributes to each line:

[Insert Drawing 4 here]

<br>

All attributes are opposite, and you obviously noticed that the first line was harder to fill since you did an unusual exercise, therefore we did it slower. Meanwhile, the second one was easier and quicker because you are used to it, it is *habitual*.
Now we will analize the movements of our hands. In the following video I will write in a retroactive manner and in a slower manner. However, each one has a motor characteristic:

* https://youtu.be/9oj1QEN4t8s

<br>

When you wrote in reverse order, did you write like in the first manner: slower but without interruptions, or like the second: fast but with intervals to think what to write next? I believe most did like the second one. If we analyze our writing when we are doing it in the normal way or the retroactive way, you can see that it is exactly the same physically. Therefore, what changes between something we are used to and not used to do is the "quantity" of thinking we do while we progress in the activity. When the acitivty is not habitual we take way more time, shown in the following picture:

[Insert Drawing 5 here]

<br>

The same happens when we do combos, and if you are using a new kind of controller, it gets way worse.
When we were younger and were learning how to write, we did go through some stages. We went through the study of letters and some notebooks of calligraphy. We went though vowels, consoants, syllabes and finally words. How much time did it take till we started writing things well on our own? 1 or 2 years? 

But when we go to combos, some people go straight to writing poetry, without preparing themselves first. Players try to imitate combo videos that only hardcore players do without knowing the basics. And the results are obvious: the players gets frustrated that he can't do them like the pros can. If we began learning how to write by trying to copying shapes we didn't even understand we would end up experiencing the same kind of frustration.

However, if you tell an adult that he has to learn how to move first and foremost (walk, dash, jump and etc.) and then that he can learn to do commands later (fireballs, dragon punchs, supers and such) so that he can finally learn a combo, he might end up saying: "This is too easy, I'll jump straight to the interesting part", therefore neglecting the base of the whole game. 

Same can be applied to a gamepad player that is migrating to an arcade stick: He might go directly to the intermediate stuff, get frustated and say "this sucks, my pad is better", which leads to the comparison of before: he has the ability to see (the skill) but doesn't know how to read the language (the technique).

If you started using arcade stick right now you might ask me: "I didn't need to go through all of this stuff when I started playing with a pad!". And the answer for that is that you probably played an older game like Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat and barely tried to do something complex, and then probably got around discovering a thing or two by pressing buttons in a happy-go-lucky way. You ended up getting used to the game without even noticing that you took your time to get used to the controls.

Now that you've grown up and is starting to use an arcade stick, you probably know that jumping around and pressing buttons like crazy won't work, but in a technical level you are pretty much a beginner since you don't know how to do the basics of the game in a comfortable manner. You probably won't be able to deal with the oponents that you fought even before because you way busier thinking how to use your stick instead.

In order to go beyond you were before, you need to retake the basic steps before going to where you were stopped ("learning the language before writing poetry"). In short, the most important is to reduce the difficulty of things till you get used to them and be able to respond without thinking too hard, and then take the next step of difficulty again and again. It's a long process, but your patience will reward you.

Now, we can take our next step in our learning process, which can be somewhat hard to deal with, specially if you are an adult: Do "you know what to do"?

<br>

### Implementing a New Technique. What's your focus?

At this point, specially to the people that changed their playing methods, it is really common to ask themselves if everything is as simple as they seem to be. If you are a new stick user, you probably thought if the pad wasn't better for you already. Let's do another exercise! In it I will demystify this false difficulty endorsed by the lack of an efficient learning method. I ask you all to follow the steps precisely, without interventions.

In the video below, there will be a phrase that will show up for a short moment. You can't repeat the video nor look for the phrase in the video's timeline preview. The phrase will show up at any point in the video, be it at the beginning, middle or end of it. **PAY ATTENTION TO IT**. If you miss it, ask another person to watch the video and tell what the phrase was. **DO NOT REPEAT IT PLEASE**.

[INSERT EXERCISE VIDEO IN ENGLISH - ORIGINAL WON'T DO IT BECAUSE IT IS IN PORTUGUESE]

<br>

Here we are recreating one common situation in a match: the opportunity for a punish. it's a moment of high tension and it's where most of the execution mistakes happen. Let's see the characteristics of this situation:

* Small oppontunity window;
* Hard execution;
* Too little time to rationalize;
* Aplicattion of a technique in a short amount of time.

<br>

Now, you may be thinking how the exercise is similar to a punish opportunity in a match?
Let's consider that making voice sounds is a skill. It is a skill that most people do (save for people that have some sort of health issue that refrains them of doing so). However, reading is a technique that is determined by regional and social context that someone finds themselves in. Therefore, if you american, there's a high probability that your native language is English. Being so, your communication skill is english speaking, while there are others like japanese speaking, spanish speaking, french speaking and etc.

In the moment of the exercise we applied our skill without much time to rationilize, and in a short time frame of the small opportunity window. Like in a fighting game, you will end up confronting inumerous small windows like that, and that you will need to apply your technique enough so that you can get the biggest amount of damage as possible.

More coming soon...
