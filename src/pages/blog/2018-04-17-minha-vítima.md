# Study of Extended Techniques and Muscular Memory applied to Fighting Games

<br>

## Introduction

In this treatise, I intend to aboard efficient and not so usual techniques for mechanical combo training in fighting games. Even though it is a basic aspect and initial for player of this genre, many players go through some difficulties when trying to execute some sequences, very often for not having a proper learning method, for having some kind of technical difficulty or for making their transition to an arcade stick.

Here, I intend to make clear some questions about how and why should we follow a determined pattern for combo training, for both people that are beginning to play fighting games right now or are trying to learn how to play with an arcade stick. I will use some of the knowledge of neurology, music theory, physiotherapy and pedagogy to show some fundamental answers to some of the questions brought here. I hope all of this interdisciplinarity gets to contribute to make the common knowledge more solid, with less “I guess“ as possible, that often comes in this kind of topic.

I really want to make clear that I want you to read and consider this document on its whole. Do not apply any of the technique here by itself without understanding the importance of each step. Read it and then come back to experiment each step in their respective order. None of these chapters survive by its own. I also have to make explicit that all of this work isn’t made to a specific game and it isn’t either about how to do advanced combos, even though I will talk and show them at one point and show why they become more possible.

The Objective here is to show advanced techniques to learn and execute in order to help the player to implement muscular memory more clearly, precisely and relaxed manner. Those are what will make the reader be able to execute harder combos. These are some examples of what became more viable with the tech I will show you:

#### Disclaimer about the videos:

>Some people might end up doubting if the execution videos I made aren't using any kind of cheat to help. In Garou: Mark of the Wolves, there’s no necessity to prove that the combo execution is real, because it was done on an arcade cabinet. But, since Kim’s combo in King of Fighters ‘98 was done on the computer, some may doubt that the execution might have been tampered.

>Therefore, for the people that doubt that it was done without any kind of help, you can check the video’s description to see the whole recording with no editing. Also, by the end of the video I prove that it was done without any cheating.

<br>
Like in the videos above, it’s possible to do advanced combos with what I will teach you here, but the main focus here is your execution and how to better it, and for that I will use the simplest examples I could bring and I will start from the most basic point when it comes to skill. The simples examples are essential since we don’t have to worry about nothing else besides execution methods, noteven about what we are executing. Futurely, the readers that will mature with these practices taught here will have maturity enough to direct themselves to study the game or combo on their own whenever they feel like.

Good read to everyone.

## Technique vs Skill

Since we aren't talking about mathematical sciences, it's hard to say what's wrong or right in fighting games. If we aboard it in a purely mechanical manner (as in hand position, layouts, arcade sticks, gamepads, hitboxes and etc.), it's hard to say what would be considered "the best way", since combos and attacks used in tournament level hardly goes far beyond the average level of execution in a game. Therefore, everything you need to win is within your technical range, be it on a stick, pad or whatever.

Though there's one thing you can be certain of: if you dropped a combo, that's because you still lack the skill to execute it or you practiced it wrong. Here we need to stablish two concepts: techinque and skill. Keep in mind that we are considering both to be completely different things. I will give an example: Your eyes might see the same image as most people in the world, but you aren't able to read the same things that a japanese person would and they won't be able to read the things you can (in this case, assuming that both only know their native language). Both have the ability (the **skill**) to see, but being able to read someone else's language is a **technique** that you can only earn by studying. Then, from that, we get the following points:
<br>

* If you drop combos of medium/low difficulty, you lack technique;
* If you have a hard time changing layouts from where your input comes from (gamepad, arcade stick, etc.) but you can play on your habitual controller, you lack technicality in your new layout;
* If you can't do the harder combos of your own character, you lack the technique, or skill or both.

<br>

### Skill

Now that we stablished that **technique** and **skill** are different things, I can tell you that we can evolve in both departments, not necessarily at the same time, but without even having to play videogames for that. In our midst, we can say that a highly able person can exert a precise neuromuscular control of their fingers, in isolated and combined different movements. Having such notable skill doesn't mean necessarily that you already qualify as an excellent player, instrumentalist or typewriter, because such ability must be trained to its language, in other words, to its technique.


<br>

### Exercises for Neuromuscular Control
Here we finally begin some training. Below I will list some exercises that will improve your neuromuscular capacity for finger control. In order to make things easier to understand, I will mark each finger with a number:

<br>

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GovWdVC.jpg)

<br>

The proposed exercises will be called: hug, hit, push and space. Below I will show each of them in order in the video:

* https://youtu.be/o9nHxQdZ-VA

<br>

Next, we have examples of wrong and right execution for all exercises:

* https://youtu.be/Ul4EQ6KNdM0

<br>

Keep in mind that we should avoid unnecessary efforts, much like in movement besides the finger you are training in each exercise. Everything must be done with the most control and looseness as possible, and that should be your priority: If you are exercising Finger 1, you move **ONLY** that finger, even if it's a small movement, in order to isolate the muscles in your hand that move them. Little by little, you start adding more amplitude and speed to these exercises.

After this first step, we can start doing finger combinations. The possible combinations of the fingers are:

* Combinations of 2 fingers: 1+2, 2+3, 3+4, 1+3, 2+4, 1+4;
* Combinations of 3 fingers: 2+3+4, 1+3+4, 1+2+4, 1+2+3.

<br>

Here is an example of combined finger training by using the "hug" exercise:

* https://youtu.be/gcXlahuUj5M

<br>

You can do the other exercises with combined fingers too, save for the "space" exercise, because that one is only done with the singular fingers (even if you did with combined it would be pretty redundant).
You should spend only 15 to 30 minutes everyday with this training, and shouldn't spend more time than that. If you hands start hurting you should stop immediately.
In order to have better control of our improvement, you can also use a metronome to help (you can use google for that, just google "metronome"). Adjust the speed to 120 BPM and do the movements every 4 beats. When you start getting used to it you can start raising the BPM. Here's a video of me doing the "push" exercise with the fingers 1+3 with a metronome:

* https://youtu.be/YObWKh8oOck

<br>

Here's an observation: If you play with a gamepad since ever (like most people that play since childhood do), you probably have already developed your ability with your thumbs greatly. When you migrate to the arcade stick, you should consider the development of the movement of all fingers. Therefore, the exercises I just gave to you might help your training a lot. Practice them everyday if you feel you have a hard time move some of your fingers individually.

<br>

### Technique

We saw that skill alone is simply about how agile our hands can be, and we can compare ourselves to musicians in this case. Here is an example of pure skillfulness:

* https://youtu.be/obs406VmUa8

<br>

Here we see that, though he is very skilled and capable, if someone who knows the musical language and recognizes technical problems, he would be able to tell that the sonority is polluted, the notes don't sound straight, there are some notes mistakes and etc. However, you can't say that there's no skill in it, or how would some say in the music community, talent.

In this case, we can see a musician that is extremely skillful in his technical plenitude:

* https://youtu.be/WSvjIUr9MHA

<br>

Now, sound is absolute, clear, clean and sound (no pun intended). All notes are audible, without noise, interference or failures. The sound quality is the result of a very well studied unique technique. This is confirmed when we pick musicians of same repertoire that requires less skill, but that needs the same technical control:

* https://youtu.be/20L6n9aZbkU
* https://youtu.be/BcI7M6OtyyI

The sound qualities, that come solely from the technical control, maintain themselves even in "difficult" repertoires or in "simpler" ones. In music, if sonority and wrong notes comes from the fruit of bad learning methods, in fighting games, dropped combos is the consequence of a inefficient training method.

<br>

<br>

## Demystifying the Learning Process

In order to make our learning process become more objective and efficient, we need firstly to understand what barriers are in our way. Let's see the first one of them:

<br>

### What is Difficulty?

Here, I ask you to stick with me in the following exercises, it might sound silly but they are important. The next exercise is absolutely fundamental to help me show you the ideas behind the study of technique. You will need a pen and a sheet of paper, and then make the following drawing:

![Drawing 1](https://i.imgur.com/uoFZWhO.jpg)

<br>

Now, I need that you fill the space above the top main horizontal line with your name and surname, in **CAPITAL LETTERS** and reverse order (but not written in the "mirrored" way). If you already done that too many times, try picking another word, any will do as long as is an unusual word. In the end, it will look like this:

![Drawing 2](https://i.imgur.com/q7LqTZE.jpg)

<br>

Next, you fill the bottom one with the same thing you wrote the first, but now in the normal order of letters:

![Drawing 3](https://i.imgur.com/TGn4rEa.jpg)

<br>

Keeping on the exercise, you can put the following attributes to each line:

![Drawing 4](https://i.imgur.com/eFNKWXb.jpg)

<br>

All attributes are opposite, and you obviously noticed that the first line was harder to fill since you did an unusual exercise, therefore we did it slower. Meanwhile, the second one was easier and quicker because you are used to it, it is *habitual*.
Now we will analize the movements of our hands. In the following video I will write in a retroactive manner and in a slower manner. However, each one has a motor characteristic:

* https://youtu.be/9oj1QEN4t8s

<br>

When you wrote in reverse order, did you write like in the first manner: slower but without interruptions, or like the second: fast but with intervals to think what to write next? I believe most did like the second one. If we analyze our writing when we are doing it in the normal way or the retroactive way, you can see that it is exactly the same physically. Therefore, what changes between something we are used to and not used to do is the "quantity" of thinking we do while we progress in the activity. When the acitivty is not habitual we take way more time, shown in the following picture:

[Drawing 5](https://i.imgur.com/vDTgRpw.jpg)

<br>

The same happens when we do combos, and if you are using a new kind of controller, it gets way worse.
When we were younger and were learning how to write, we did go through some stages. We went through the study of letters and some notebooks of calligraphy. We went though vowels, consoants, syllabes and finally words. How much time did it take till we started writing things well on our own? 1 or 2 years? 

But when we go to combos, some people go straight to writing poetry, without preparing themselves first. Players try to imitate combo videos that only hardcore players do without knowing the basics. And the results are obvious: the players gets frustrated that he can't do them like the pros can. If we began learning how to write by trying to copying shapes we didn't even understand we would end up experiencing the same kind of frustration.

However, if you tell an adult that he has to learn how to move first and foremost (walk, dash, jump and etc.) and then that he can learn to do commands later (fireballs, dragon punchs, supers and such) so that he can finally learn a combo, he might end up saying: "This is too easy, I'll jump straight to the interesting part", therefore neglecting the base of the whole game. 

Same can be applied to a gamepad player that is migrating to an arcade stick: He might go directly to the intermediate stuff, get frustated and say "this sucks, my pad is better", which leads to the comparison of before: he has the ability to see (the skill) but doesn't know how to read the language (the technique).

If you started using arcade stick right now you might ask me: "I didn't need to go through all of this stuff when I started playing with a pad!". And the answer for that is that you probably played an older game like Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat and barely tried to do something complex, and then probably got around discovering a thing or two by pressing buttons in a happy-go-lucky way. You ended up getting used to the game without even noticing that you took your time to get used to the controls.

Now that you've grown up and is starting to use an arcade stick, you probably know that jumping around and pressing buttons like crazy won't work, but in a technical level you are pretty much a beginner since you don't know how to do the basics of the game in a comfortable manner. You probably won't be able to deal with the oponents that you fought even before because you way busier thinking how to use your stick instead.

In order to go beyond you were before, you need to retake the basic steps before going to where you were stopped ("learning the language before writing poetry"). In short, the most important is to reduce the difficulty of things till you get used to them and be able to respond without thinking too hard, and then take the next step of difficulty again and again. It's a long process, but your patience will reward you.

Now, we can take our next step in our learning process, which can be somewhat hard to deal with, specially if you are an adult: Do "you know what to do"?

<br>

### Implementing a New Technique. What's your focus?

At this point, specially to the people that changed their playing methods, it is really common to ask themselves if everything is as simple as they seem to be. If you are a new stick user, you probably thought if the pad wasn't better for you already. Let's do another exercise! In it I will demystify this false difficulty endorsed by the lack of an efficient learning method. I ask you all to follow the steps precisely, without interventions.

In the video below, there will be a phrase that will show up for a short moment. You can't repeat the video nor look for the phrase in the video's timeline preview. The phrase will show up at any point in the video, be it at the beginning, middle or end of it. **PAY ATTENTION TO IT**. If you miss it, ask another person to watch the video and tell what the phrase was. **DO NOT REPEAT IT PLEASE**.

[INSERT EXERCISE VIDEO IN ENGLISH - ORIGINAL WON'T DO IT BECAUSE IT IS IN PORTUGUESE]

<br>

Here we are recreating one common situation in a match: the opportunity for a punish. it's a moment of high tension and it's where most of the execution mistakes happen. Let's see the characteristics of this situation:

* Small oppontunity window;
* Hard execution;
* Too little time to rationalize;
* Aplicattion of a technique in a short amount of time.

<br>

Now, you may be thinking how the exercise is similar to a punish opportunity in a match?
Let's consider that making voice sounds is a skill. It is a skill that most people do (save for people that have some sort of health issue that refrains them of doing so). However, reading is a technique that is determined by regional and social context that someone finds themselves in. Therefore, if you american, there's a high probability that your native language is English. Being so, your communication skill is english speaking, while there are others like japanese speaking, spanish speaking, french speaking and etc.

In the moment of the exercise we applied our skill without much time to rationilize, and in a short time frame of the small opportunity window. Like in a fighting game, you will end up confronting inumerous small windows like that, and that you will need to apply your technique enough so that you can get the biggest amount of damage as possible.

The situation we created in the video is very opressive and induces to make mistakes, even though the words were written in the wrong manner, your read might've been correct. Now you are allowed to read what was in the video with calm. You see that the words "home" and "disappeared" have letters in mixed order and the word "hamster" has a "4" instead of an A.
That happens because, since you have to do some fat reading, you simply don't have enough time to rationalize and tend to execute actions automatically, which makes you brain process accordingly to the knowledge you have learned beforehand. Therefore, your brain will go for a muscular memory that fits the situation properly and execute it. You don't know the words "h4mster", "diasppeaerd" and "hoem" but you do know "hamster", "disappeared" and "home", and so you will read them like if they were right since they have similar visuals, since you use them in your regular life. 

Now, imagine that you weren't an arcade stick user, just managed to get one after years of playing on a gamepad, went to play your favorite FG and saw an opportunity for a punish. What will you brain do? The answer is that it will go for the most obvious direct response he has in your brain, that can't be done because you are not using a pad anymore.

Now, let's get to what really makes we learn new techniques: forgetting the old ones. The problems really comes when you already know what to do, can do, but cannot do on your new controller. In order to get going with your new life, you need to **never** think about going back to the old one: *it doesn't exist anymore*. Secondly, reduce the difficulty of the tasks you are executing and be aware of how you are doing it and if you are doing it correctly. Therefore, forget about playing online matches, forget about playing high level CPUs. You should spend something like 1 or 2 months only training, barely playing (if at all) against something and then go for the single player modes, and then, to the online matches (with the lower level players and then working on harder opponents).

That's fundamental, since you will end up getting into situations that you don't have enough time to rationalize, and your muscle memory will go towards executions that are impossible to do on what you are using. If you try to rationalize, you will end up on the situation of "writing in reverse order", where you execution will become slow, confused and probably erroneous.

If you understood that it will take quite some time of your life, then we can keep going to the next stage of training.

<br>

## Controller of your Choice

The choice of what technique to improve must part from a concious choice and a really basic question: what will offer me the most control? the conclusion that some might come with is: "it's the gamepad because it is the controller that I play the best". Like we said before, that's just because you are used to it but it doesn't necessarily mean it's better, since it has some flaws that makes some inputs harder to execute. Next up, we will analyze all sorts of controllers and methods of using them, and with that analysis we will have some basic idea of which fundamentals we have to apply in order to improve our technique.

<br>

### Gamepad 

So, let's face straight up the biggest problem of the Pad: the restriction of the thumbs. In older fighting games that might not pose much of a problem, but with how Fighting Games work nowadays (with myriads of commands and combinations) you will need to use more of your right hand to execute more demanding stuff. Some Pads that are made for FGs mgiht mitigate this problem a little, but it doesn't change the fact that the face buttons are mostly made to be pressed with your thumb, and even if you don't use only your thumb for them other controllers are probably a more comfortable choice because of the button size and less awkward hand position.
Another problem that Pads might add is the lack of padronization: you will end up depending on the quality of controllers of each new generation of console and the quality of 3rd party Fighting Games Pads, which can merely not exist futurely too.

<br>

### Keyboard/Hitbox

Here we have a really good control system. Each direction and attack button is assigned to a specific finger, making so that most if not all of your fingers are well utilized.
You having directions buttons at your disposal also means that you might be able to apply techniques that you use for attack buttons to your movement too.

The minor difference between a Hitbox and a Keyboard is that the Hitbox has bigger buttons and more free space between them to be more comfortable, while keyboards you have multiple buttons keys around which might get in the way when pressing simultaneos buttons.

The biggest problem a keyboard, a hitbox or whatever alternative methods we use is that they are not the norm: You will become dependant of your own controller, and if you have to need a substitute for some reason while in tournaments, you will hardly perform as well as in your own setup, and that becomes 10x more accentuated with hitboxes since it's harder to find people who uses it.

<br>

### Arcade Stick - Traditional Posture

Let's see the traditional way of holding an arcade stick, where the left hand revovles around the movement stick:

[Arcade Stick Traditional Image]

<br>

Like in the Hitbox/Keyboard, your right hand becomes free to press multiple button with ease. What we will focus here is what the left hand does:

[Arcade Stick Traditional Directions Image]

<br>

Since your hand is revolving around the whole balltop, some of the movements are restringed, and you will need to use your whole arm if you need a finger like your thumbs make the movement to upwards or left, for example. In this way, the only directions were you can choose if you want to use your fingers or your arm to move is downwards or its diagonals, which means you can do movement without "overlapping".

Let me explain what's the deal with overlapping movement: When you do movements that you have only one option (I mean in a comfortable manner), like moving your arm to press foward on the stick, you will be obligated to move your arm to the neutral position in order to do that movement again. That means you can't do an overlap.

When you have two ways of applying movement to the stick, you can do one while preemptively applying the other after the first is done (overlapping them), therefore applying moves much faster and without much hassle. Something similar to that but applied to buttons is the "piano" movement done in order to execute Chun Li's Lightning Kick, is a way more pratical and precise way of doing so than mashing the same button like crazy in hopes for it to go out finally.

<br>

### Arcade Stick - Wineglass

Here I will show the control method I use for Arcade Stick and that's also the one I think it's the best to grow used to. I really recommend this method because it makes things less stressful when it comes to input speed with directions.

Let's show the hands position for wineglass:

[Arcade Stick Wineglass Image]

<br>

The right hand is the same as the Tradiitonal Arcade Stick and Hitbox. Let's see what the left hand offers:

[Arcade Stick Wineglass Directions Image]

<br>

Here I show the two mains advantages of the Wineglass hold:

* The Balltop isn't restringed by your hand;
* Each direction has more than one way of applying movement, being most of them done by your thumbs.

The directions 4, 7, 8, 9 and 6 can be executed by both your arm and your thumbs (if you don't know what these numbers mean go google "fighting games number notation", it will help you in a lot of anime games or japanese methods of combo writing). Since we can do these directions with both ways, things like dash, air dash and Dragon Punch become easier to do by just applying one direction with your thumb and then with your arm or vice-versa. Another example is doing a simple movement for crouch guard: use your middle finger or ring finger to press direction 2, and then use your arm pull backwards for 4, which will end up naturally on 1.

* https://youtu.be/ph75ffvA9Tk

<br>

For an instant air dash (IAD), you can do direction 9 and do 6 with your arm fast while your thumb is going back from 9:

* https://youtu.be/Am3_f04dd9Y

<br>

Since every technique isn't flawless, you can see that in the last video, the IAD didn't go too far even if the input was right, since it was fast enough that the height for the jump wasn't enough to the airdash to be recognized. Here is the same input done slower:

* https://youtu.be/rCRzjh4EiAg

<br>

With the Wineglass hold, each direction can be done more individually and faster since repetitive direction are done by different parts of your body. This is one of the aspects that made possible combos done in the beginning of this study. This way, the dash comes instantly with not a lot of stress on the arm, which leads to easier execution. Please watch these videos again, and look at the dassh execution:

* Garou: Mark of the Wolves - B. Jenet (13 Feint Cancels):
https://youtu.be/is5rYx5Y2is

<br>

* King of Fighters 98 - Kim Kaphwan (5 Haki Cancels):
https://youtu.be/NkHtHxC2YZk

<br>

Once again, none of the directions are really needed to be done by your arm, which might be the slowest member to move, which means it's preferred that you use your fingers most of the time save for quick repeated directions.

<br>

---

## Rewriting Muscular Memory

Once you have chosen which controller you are going to stick with, we will begin with defining which fundamental elements are taking part of our execution. Our main objective here is to develop a technique that is clean, relaxed and free from errors as much as possible, therefore we have to assume that there's only one best option of doing so. 

This execution method will only fit us if we understand it in depth and to get to that we will go through 3 steps of analysis: Sensorial Movement Development, Continuous Movement Development and Consistent Movement Development. For each level of execution we will go through the steps mentioned before. For example, in order to learn a better way of doing a dash, we will do sensorial training, then continuity training, and lastly consistency training. The same will be done with special attack motions (fireball, dragon punch, charges and such) and then for combos.

<br>

### Sensorial Movement Development

During the writing and reading exercises, we understood that if we practice certain actions, we are conduced to execute them without the need to rationalize it. So, to guarantee that our minds selects the right actions, we need a rigid training in order to develop our muscular memory through a sensorial practice.

This time, we develop our movements in instances. In others words, we have to focus in each minimal thought of a movement execution, for example: when we press direction 6 on the controller, what's the best way of doing so? What part of the finger should you use? How's the sensation of pressing the button/moving the stick? That said, we will register in our memories how each movement has to be done in order to become more precise for later steps of the training in the final chapters.

One thing important to notice: Most of the execution mistakes that you might end up doing is probably because of the accumulated tension from previous commands. E.g.: In Garou, if you are doing feint cancels with Jae Hoon, you might end up dropping on the 4th or 5th feint. That's not because you still don't know how to do feint cancels properly, but because you accumulated so much tension over the execution os the feint cancels that you couldn't do more properly and you didn't manage to get some resting time between commands.

At some point of the execution, the concept of "proper" was left behind and the idea of "good enough" took priority, which is the same as "proper done wrong". "Be able to do combos" works in matches but not in training. From now on, just being able to do attacks is not the point, but being able to do clean inputs is. For that, sensorial development is essential, because it gives us the sense of what is a relaxed and precise execution.
